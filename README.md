# Product Search Filter

This is a simple React application that implements a search filter for products. The search filter allows users to search products based on name, price range, color, and category. The application uses local data and does not rely on any external search libraries or APIs.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Alotab/Advance-React-filtering.git
```

2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and run:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the app: Run the following command to start the React development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

4. Search and filter products: Use the search input to filter products by name, select the desired price range, color, and category to narrow down the list of displayed products.
